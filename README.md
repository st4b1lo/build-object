Useful script to create objects (IP and FQDN) starting from a list, the list provided can dynamically contain any type of fqdn or subnet, the result is that it will be correctly formatted and grouped together to be able to apply in total. 
The script is useful when providing a large amount of ip and fqdn (e.g. a list of IOCs) and needs to be applied in a short time.
